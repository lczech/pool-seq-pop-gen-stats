@article{Bhatia2013,
    abstract = {In a pair of seminal papers, Sewall Wright and Gustave Mal{\'{e}}cot introduced FST as a measure of structure in natural populations. In the decades that followed, a number of papers provided differing definitions, estimation methods, and interpretations beyond Wright's. While this diversity in methods has enabled many studies in genetics, it has also introduced confusion regarding how to estimate FST from available data. Considering this confusion, wide variation in published estimates of FST for pairs of HapMap populations is a cause for concern. These estimates changed-in some cases more than twofold-when comparing estimates from genotyping arrays to those from sequence data. Indeed, changes in FST from sequencing data might be expected due to population genetic factors affecting rare variants. While rare variants do influence the result, we show that this is largely through differences in estimation methods. Correcting for this yields estimates of FST that are much more concordant between sequence and genotype data. These differences relate to three specific issues: (1) estimating FST for a single SNP, (2) combining estimates of FST across multiple SNPs, and (3) selecting the set of SNPs used in the computation. Changes in each of these aspects of estimation may result in FST estimates that are highly divergent from one another. Here, we clarify these issues and propose solutions. {\textcopyright} 2013, Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

@article{Hudson1992,
    abstract = {We compare the utility of two methods for estimating the average levels of gene flow from DNA sequence data. One method is based on estimating F(ST) from frequencies at polymorphic sites, treating each site as a separate locus. The other method is based on computing the minimum number of migration events consistent with the gene tree inferred from their sequences. We compared the performance of these two methods on data that were generated by a computer simulation program that assumed the infinite sites model of mutation and that assumed an island model of migration. We found that in general when there is no recombination, the cladistic method performed better than F(ST) while the reverse was true for rates of recombination similar to those found in eukaryotic nuclear genes, although F(ST) performed better for all recombination rates for very low levels of migration (Nm = 0.1).},

Results of genome-wide analyses can be graphically displayed in a sliding window plot. PoPoolation is written in Perl and R and it builds on commonly used data formats.

Furthermore, we evaluate the influence of mapping algorithms, sequencing errors, and read coverage on the accuracy of population genetic parameter estimates from pooled data.},

@article{Achaz2008,
    abstract = {Many data sets one could use for population genetics contain artifactual sites, i.e., sequencing errors. Here, we first explore the impact of such errors on several common summary statistics, assuming that sequencing errors are mostly singletons. We thus show that in the presence of those errors, estimators of u can be strongly biased. We further show that even with a moderate number of sequencing errors, neutrality tests based on the frequency spectrum reject neutrality. This implies that analyses of data sets with such errors will systematically lead to wrong inferences of evolutionary scenarios. To avoid to these errors, we propose two new estimators of $\theta$ that ignore singletons as well as two new tests Y and Y* that can be used to test neutrality despite sequencing errors. All in all, we show that even though singletons are ignored, these new tests show some power to detect deviations from a standard neutral model. We therefore advise the use of these new tests to strengthen conclusions in suspicious data sets. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Genetics Society of America.},

@article{Karlsson2007,
    abstract = {With several hundred genetic diseases and an advantageous genome structure, dogs are ideal for mapping genes that cause disease. Here we report the development of a genotyping array with ∼27,000 SNPs and show that genome-wide association mapping of mendelian traits in dog breeds can be achieved with only ∼20 dogs. Specifically, we map two traits with mendelian inheritance: the major white spotting (S) locus and the hair ridge in Rhodesian ridgebacks. For both traits, we map the loci to discrete regions of {\textless}1 Mb. Fine-mapping of the S locus in two breeds refines the localization to a region of ∼100 kb contained within the pigmentation-related gene MITF. Complete sequencing of the white and solid haplotypes identifies candidate regulatory mutations in the melanocyte-specific promoter of MITF. Our results show that genome-wide association mapping within dog breeds, followed by fine-mapping across multiple breeds, will be highly efficient and generally applicable to trait mapping, providing insights into canine and human health. {\textcopyright} 2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

@article{Hivert2018,
    abstract = {The advent of high throughput sequencing and genotyping technologies enables the comparison of patterns of polymorphisms at a very large number of markers. While the characterization of genetic structure from individual sequencing data remains expensive for many nonmodel species, it has been shown that sequencing pools of individual DNAs (Pool-seq) represents an attractive and cost-effective alternative. However, analyzing sequence read counts from a DNA pool instead of individual genotypes raises statistical challenges in deriving correct estimates of genetic differentiation. In this article, we provide a method-of-moments estimator of [Formula: see text] for Pool-seq data, based on an analysis-of-variance framework. We show, by means of simulations, that this new estimator is unbiased and outperforms previously proposed estimators. We evaluate the robustness of our estimator to model misspecification, such as sequencing errors and uneven contributions of individual DNAs to the pools. Finally, by reanalyzing published Pool-seq data of different ecotypes of the prickly sculpin Cottus asper, we show how the use of an unbiased [Formula: see text] estimator may question the interpretation of population structure inferred from previous analyses.},
